# CSV Data Processor – Group 5 Software Development Project

Welcome to the **Group 5 Software Development Project (2025)**.  
This project focuses on building a **CSV Data Processor** — a Java application that can read, validate, transform, and write CSV data efficiently using object-oriented design and clean coding practices.

---

## Project Overview

The **CSV Data Processor** will:

- Read CSV files with configurable delimiters, quotes, and escape characters.
- Support type validation via a schema (string, integer, decimal, date, etc.).
- Handle malformed or missing data through structured error reporting.
- Stream large CSVs efficiently without high memory use.
- (Optional) Perform filters, transforms, aggregations, and joins between CSVs.

The goal is to apply **software design principles**, **team collaboration**, and **test-driven development** using modern Java tooling.
